<h1>Western calligraphy</h1>
        <section>
          <h4>1.What subjects does Western calligraphy include?</h4>
          <p class="p">
              Calligraphy is an art form whose artwork is texts, sentences, or just a word, a letter 
              that are presented and created in a beautiful and artistic way.
              In my opinion, Western Calligraphy includes 3 main art disciplines: Calligraphy, Hand - 
              lettering and Typography.
          </p>
          <h5>a: CALLIGRAPHY.</h5>
          <p class="p">
  Calligraphy is the art of beautiful handwriting, the art of using a pen to write beautiful letters, Calligraphy is just a discipline in Western calligraphy art, however it is the foundational subject, the quintessence, the soul. of Western Calligraphy. All other disciplines in this art branch were developed from it. For these reasons, the discipline of Calligraphy can be used to represent the whole art of Western Calligraphy.
  
  Calligraphy is mainly used in writing and designing text. From the pages of the Bible meticulously handwritten by artisans over the years to the letter written when suddenly remembering a muse. Calligraphy appears in everything from the simple to the great, Calligraphy is for everyone, even if you are not artistically gifted, whether you write with your left or right hand, even write with your feet, in Any age, you can come to Calligraphy. That's what I love the most, the best thing about Calligraphy.
         </p>
          <h5>b: HAND - LETERING.</h5>
          <p class="p">
  Hand lettering is the art of creating shapes by hand. In the simplest and most understandable way, Calligraphy writes letters, and Hand Lettering draws letters.
  As an art that evolved from Calligraphy, Hand Lettering is used in the design of headlines, the first letter of a piece of text to make Calligraphy more flowery or stand alone as a work of art.

          </p>
           <h5>c: TYPOGRAPHY.</h5>
           <p class="p">
  Typography is the art of arrangement and typesetting, Typography is developed based on both Calligraphy and Hand lettering. Different from the above two subjects, Typography is an art that uses both Pen and computer and technology when performing.
  Composition is the most important thing that makes up a Typograpy work. If Calligraphy designs its text in a horizontal layout, Typography only designs one sentence, one word but in many different layout directions such as wavy, converging, concentric.
  Typography is used most often in the design of titles, posters, logos and in print.
  If you are a young person, surfing facebook a lot, you will probably sometimes encounter a black and white photo "so deep" and on it is printed a sentence full of mood, most of which are typographic works made by machine. count.
          </p>
          <h4>2.Pen in calligraphy-divided by level</h4>
          <h5>a:Flat pen(Stub pen or calligraphy pen Flat style).</h5>
          <p class="p">Flat Pen is used a lot in Calligraphy, most of the typefaces in Calligraphy are written in Flat Pen: Roman, Italic, Rotunda, Caroline, and especially Gothic (Note, these typefaces include many Fonts. different).
              Flat Pen is considered to be the group of pens with the simplest and easiest way to write. How to write Flat Pen is very simple: it is always to follow the PRINCIPLES.
              The most important rule is always control the angle of the pen nib.
              The second rule is to always adhere to the strokes in the font.
              The third rule is to always adhere to the height of each font</p>
              <div class="zoom"><img style="margin-left:200px" src="/assets/image/flat-pen.gif" alt=""></div>
              
              <p style="margin-left:350px;margin-top: 20px;">Flat pen</p>
          <p class="p">In Flat Pen practice, in my opinion everyone should start practicing from Font FOUNDITIONAL HAND. This is Font developed based on Font Caroline minuscule. 
              It is used in practice due to the simplicity and clarity of the spelling. To write this font well, my advice to you is to practice drawing straight and even 
              horizontal lines on paper every day <br>
              Referring to Flat Pen, one cannot help but mention Gothic (with many other names such as Black letter, Old English, German script....)
              Gothic is considered the most formal typeface in Western Calligraphy with dozens of different fonts, it has a tragic history throughout 
              the Renaissance until the war with the Aqua typeface in its use. The everyday European typeface, Gothic has been defeated by Aqua in many 
              countries, and only holds firm in Germany. By 1941, Germany declared to use the Aqua typeface as the standard typeface, Gothic ended its more than 5 century history as its standard typeface, leaving a real mourning for those who missed a font. times love it.
          </p> 
          <h5>b:Alex pen.</h5>
          <p class="p">Flex Pen is a group of pens with a flexible pointy nib that can be split apart to create bold strokes according to the pressure of the nib. 
              Because the width of the bold bar is determined by the pressure of the hand, it is considered to be more difficult to write than the Flat pen. 
              Two typical Flex pen typefaces are Copperplate script and Spencerian script.

              <p style="margin-left:350px;margin-top: 20px;">Flex pen</p>
          <p class="p">Copperplate script is a typeface that is quite familiar to Vietnamese people, the bold bar typeface is considered a variant Font of Copperplate. 
              The principle of writing Copperplate is that the up stroke is the bar stroke, the downward stroke is the bold stroke. The more even the text, the clearer the bold bars, the better the text.</p>
              
              <div class="zoom"><img style="margin-left:70px" src="/assets/image/copperplate.png" alt=""></div>
              <p style="margin-left:350px;margin-top: 20px;">Copperplate script</p>
          <p class="p">Spencercian Scrpit is a typeface for fast writing by only bolding important points in a word, thus speeding up writing and reducing hand fatigue.</p>    
              
              <div class="zoom"><img style="margin-left: 200px;" src="/assets/image/spencian script.png" alt=""></div>
              <p style="margin-left:350px;margin-top: 20px;">Spencercian script</p>
          <h5>c: brush pen.</h5>
          <p class="p">Brush Pen is a brush used in Calligraphy, it includes 2 types: soft nib and hard nib. The soft nib is that the entire nib is very soft, and the hard 
              nib is only the tip of the soft nib, the root of the nib is treated with glue, so it is very hard, so when pressed with full force, the stroke width does not change.
              The most important feature of the Brush Pen is that the nib is very soft, so it is difficult to control the nib. A small change, a change of breathing is 
              enough to make the brush stroke change compared to normal, so the Brush Pen is considered a difficult pen to write and only those at the Master level can write 
              hundreds of words evenly. as one. Because of this property, hard nibs are much easier to write than soft nibs.
              Unlike Flat pen when writing must adhere to strict guidelines, Brush Pen is very customizable and is therefore popularly used in Typography. As I mentioned above, 
              the most important thing in Typography is composition, and the Brush Pen offers the ability to change the angle of inclination customarily according to the composition of the work.</p>

              <p style="margin-left:390px;margin-top: 20px;">Brush pen</p>
          <h5>d:Rulling Pen.</h5>
          <p class="p">Rulling Pen, the pinnacle pen for Masters. Due to the nature of the extremely wide nib, much ink down, difficult to control, Rulling Pen is the most difficult 
              pen to write and especially there are never two Identical letters. Even Master Calligraphers cannot write two words exactly the same. A Rulling Pen can have a lock to 
              control the opening of the nib, because the ink drops quickly, so when writing, the writer has to emphasize and swipe very fast, so scratching the paper is also a lot. 
              Therefore, the Rulling Pen writing paper is about 300gsm thick.</p>
