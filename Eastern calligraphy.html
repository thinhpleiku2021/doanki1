          <h4>1.Chinese calligraphy</h4>
       <p class="p">
      East Asian calligraphy (Chinese: 東亞書法, East Asian calligraphy) is the art of beautiful 
      handwriting formed from the practice of writing Chinese characters. People use brush, dot 
      Chinese ink, write Chinese characters on fine paper or silk fabric, in different styles. In
      Asian calligraphy art, there are 5 writing styles: Chan (also known as Khai), Trien, Le, 
      Hanh and Thao with their own specific rules of lines and expression. <br>
           The Chinese believe that Ly Tu, the prime minister of the Qin court, was the originator of 
           the art of calligraphy because he was the one who was assigned the task of reforming and 
           unifying writing after Qin Shi Huang annexed the countries. another small country to bring 
           China into a unified country. Over the following dynasties, history books have recorded 
           the appearance of famous calligraphers (who wrote beautiful letters), such as Vuong Hy 
           Chi (Dong Jin Dynasty) or Qi Bach Thach (Qing Dynasty)...
           <br>
           This is the earliest, strongest and most powerful line of calligraphy that has had a profound 
           influence on the calligraphy lines of other languages ​in East Asia. Chinese calligraphy is 
           not only a discipline of the art of China and Taiwan alone but also of the Chinese culture 
           .... Many calligraphers in countries located in the influence of Chinese culture such as 
           Japan , Korea, and Vietnam also compose calligraphy works in Chinese characters. <br>
           </p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <h4>2. Vietnam calligraphy</h4>
           <p class="p"> 
           Vietnamese calligraphy consists of two lines: Han-Nom calligraphy and Quoc Ngu (Latin script) calligraphy.<br>
         <b>Calligraphy in Chinese and Nom:</b><br>
         Vietnam belongs to the East Asian cultural region, so Chinese calligraphy and Nom script are generally similar to those of China. However, some documents such as Kien Van Tieu Luc by Le Quy Don or Vu Trung Commentary by Pham Dinh Ho also briefly mention and distinguish the Chinese writing style of Vietnamese and Northern people. <br>
         The famous poet of the Le-Nguyen Dynasty Pham Dinh Ho mentioned a writing style of the Southern people under the Le dynasty that he called Nam Tu and he compared it with the writing style of the Northern people, which he called Bac Tu. This style of writing is still seen on many ordinations, epitaphs, etc. left from the Le Dynasty. Scholar Nguyen Su believes that in order to achieve the unification of Nam's script, it is necessary to mention the role of King Le Thanh Tong in the administrative reform he proposed.
         The Dai Viet historical records of the Toan Thu recorded the decrees on the unification of mandarin writing style as follows: in the 9th year of Quang Thuan: "The Decree of Le Bo regulates the forms of folk writing and promulgates it to the world." ; The 8th year of Hong Duc: "The decree of the royal guards, using uppercase letters, must be respectfully observed and implemented." The characteristic of administrative writing style of the Le dynasty was that the stroke was flat, straight, hiding the head and the tail, the last strokes often tended to be pushed upwards and later on, this trend became more and more pompous and the difficulty in writing was high. than in the Mac and Le Trung Hung dynasties
         <br>
         In Le Trung Hung's time, this Southern script was completed with the feature of "twisting head and legs".The way the pen is used is dangerous, the crystal is tightly closed, it seems to follow the round block, not in the square like the usual Khai word.Originating from administrative use, but this style of writing gradually was used for both diaphragms, couplets, epitaphs, etc. in pagodas and almost dominated the letters of the Le Trung Hung period. Pham Dinh Ho said: "...the papers in public places are used exclusively in the Southern script. At first it was the folk room made forged, then according to the pattern, it created a mandarin script. Who follows it? That style of writing, every six years, the matriculation exam is added as a footnote in the dental offices.According to the Viet History Compendium, during the Le dynasty, the writing exam consisted of three parts: Dai Thu, Lady and Lenh Thu. This mentioned command letter style may be the word used in decrees and administrative regulations. At the end of the Le Dynasty, Lord Trinh Sam's love of the Northern scriptreturned to more liberal styles, dispelling a long period of monolithic vernacular typology. The Southern writing style of the Le dynasty, although it came from the pragmatic purpose of mandarin's writing, has also created a unique artistic mark for Vietnamese calligraphy in the overall Asian classical literature. <br>
       <b>Calligraphy in Quoc Ngu:</b><br>
       Quoc Ngu calligraphy appeared in the 1930s, the period when Quoc Ngu script (Latin script) began to be more popular than Chinese and Nom characters in Vietnam during the French colonial period. Beginning with the poet Dong Ho, he wrote calligraphy with an iron pen. Later, the calligrapher Nhat Linh wrote a number of prints in magazines, but it was not a movement. It was not until later that monk Minh Duc Trieu Tam Anh started the movement to write Quoc Ngu calligraphy with brush. The original Calligraphy Club only had calligrapher Nguyen Dinh and monk Minh Duc Trieu Tam Anh playing Quoc Ngu calligraphy. Up to now, Quoc Ngu calligraphy has attracted many people's attention. Also because Quoc Ngu is a Latin script, many people make use of Quoc Ngu calligraphy to write calligraphy for foreign languages ​​like English. <br>

          <p class="p"> Calligraphy in Japan is called calligraphy. According to Japanese calligraphy experts, kanji was transmitted from China to Japan about 2000 years ago, popularly used in Japan from about the 5th century. Then, based on kanji, people Japan created its own typeface, Hiragana and Katakana (bar typeface). Japanese calligraphy is formed from two main types of characters: Chinese characters from China and Hiragana and Katakana. Currently, in Japan there are 8 to 10 million people engaged in calligraphy, and calligraphy is considered one of the unique arts of Japan. Calligraphy is also added as a small subject in schools, students are trained in how to sharpen ink and how to write. <br>
           <b>Chinese calligraphy</b><br>
           Created by relying on poetry, classical prose written in Chinese characters, based on each person's artistic perception and calligraphy learning method through works from many words to few words, and various types of calligraphy. such as Ten (Seal Book), Rei (Literary Book), Kai (Kai Shu), Gyo (Hang Shu), So (Thao Book), search for the inherent calligraphy genre.

There is a rich expression according to the different intentions of the authors about the ancient songs that Kana calligraphy. The beauty of modern Kana is mixed with the new feeling of large-letter Kana (the origin of the word Kana is small).
           <b>Calligraphy and modern poetry (modern literary poetry)</b>
           These are works that take modern literature and poetry as themes, harmonizing Chinese and Kana characters to create a new calligraphy.

           <b>Calligraphy in large letters (Great Letters)</b>
           These are calligraphic works written in large letters with only 1 or 2 words in number. A new world of calligraphy is created by shaping the shape, refining the lines and creating the black color. <br>
           <b>Calligraphy printed with stone carving - Tenkoku (Seal engraving)</b> <br>
           This discipline is said to be the quintessence of the East and the calligraphy world. Letters are printed in a 3-inch square mold. Ancient Chinese calligraphy and writing were carved in stone and then printed on white paper, creating a beautiful contrast between the (red) ink and the paper. Tekuko is a new sense of shaping based on tradition blended in a small space. <br>
           <b>Woodblock calligraphy (Self-engraving)</b> <br>
           The writing is engraved on the wooden plate. The writing here is different from pen writing, it is stereoscopic and can also be colored with many colors. Engraving is a calligraphy discipline that is attracting attention. <br>
           <b>ZenEi Calligraphy (Letter Midfielder)</b> <br>
           This discipline changes the previous perception of calligraphy (regarding calligraphy as an expression of human personality).

        <h4>4. Korean calligraphy</h4> 
        <p class="p">
          Although Koreans created their own script as early as 1446, kanji was still used as an official official form until the end of the 19th century. Traditional Korean calligraphy still uses traditional Chinese calligraphy. Use Chinese characters, not Korean characters. <br>
          Under the influence of Chinese culture, Calligraphy in Korea has a close relationship with painting, even some people think that, from the perspective of strong but flexible and harmonious in calligraphy, painting itself Korea is heavily influenced by Calligraphy. So people often hang a calligraphy on the wall or in the room and enjoy it like enjoying a painting. <br>
          A beautiful word picture in addition to being created from the arrangement of strokes and letters in a regular manner; It also exudes the interweaving and harmonization of pen, materials, and writing techniques such as habitation, suspension, and cutting, on the basis of the subtlety of the sensations from the hands with the artistic spirit and emotion. author's art. All create a Calligraphy with aesthetics in delicate harmony. <br>
          From a technical perspective, the art of Calligraphy is determined by the technique used and the movement through the tip of the pen from the writer's vibe. The introduction of textures on the basis of a combined layout of strokes with different moods, or after starting the pen and having drawn the brushstrokes, is not filled or supplemented, or most importantly, the focus on A reasonable, harmonious distribution that even takes many years to achieve is the basic requirement of writing a real Calligraphy work. <br>
          In the early period of the Goryeo period, the dominant force of Korea at that time was modeled after the Chinese court, applying the examination system to select mandarins through the official examination according to the thesis system. and of course handwriting becomes the top criterion for selection. And since then, practicing writing has become an interest of contemporary officials and public figures. Not only that, the court also recruited officials to take care of writing in the palace, and writing was more focused than ever. It was this period that left many classic Korean Calligraphy works on many areas including tombstones, woodblock prints, manuscripts, inscriptions on Buddhist stupas and stone steles in temples. monastery. This period is famous for Ly Nham, Ly Te Hien, Tu Tuc Dat and Han Doan. <br>
          Calligraphy of the Korean period originally worshiped the body of Trieu Manh Phu, the Zhao body written by the 3rd The Tong, Anping Daijun (1418-1453), can be said to reach an incomparable peak. The painter at the same time who was also very famous for him was also honored to have him write the word on his famous painting "Dream Dug Nguyen Tu". Han Lo (1543-1605), a contemporary calligrapher who is equally famous in the history of Korean calligraphy with the stage name Thach Phong Nhat, has only used the surname Vuong all his life, writing Vuong to the quintessential level, but Unfortunately, he has not yet created his own writing style. At the beginning of the 16th century, with the decline of society and people's life, a writing style with weak, soft, and lack of imagination appeared, Korean Calligraphy began to fall into the era. Depression. <br>
          Until the 19th century, Koreans returned to the writing style of the Chinese writer Van Trung Minh that they had forgotten many centuries before. This stems from the close relationship that brought back the cultural exchange of the Han people with the Qing dynasty. The Koreans used that as a way to nominate themselves to the Qing dynasty as a response for their nation's future to become more modern. <br>
          The most famous calligrapher of the Korean era must be Kim Chinh Hy of the real school, who was both a calligrapher and a scholar, he created a style that people called the "Autumn history school". . His style is born out of the Chinese version of the book, the composition is full of painting, harmonizing in the asymmetry, while the pen is extremely assertive, the pen is full of power. That makes his reputation even today in Korean Calligraphy. <br>
          The 20s and 30s of the 20th century were still the period of traditional Korean calligraphy, but then began to be influenced by Japanese calligraphy. After the end of World War II, traditional calligraphy became an art that has always been preserved, but with the emergence of new calligraphy movements, Korea began to have modern calligraphy and calligraphy. Korean is also popularized and used. In the eyes and eyes of Koreans, Calligraphy is a pinnacle art, always revered and respected. "Calligraphy" Koreans call it "Art of Letters".
