      <h4>1.Calligraphy definition</h4>
      <p>Calligraphy (from Greek: καλλιγραφία) is a visual art related to writing. It is the design and execution of 
        lettering with a pen, ink brush, or other writing instrument.A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as 
        "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".

        Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not 
        be readable.Classical calligraphy differs from type design and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.
        
        Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of wedding invitations and event invitations, font design and typography, 
        original hand-lettered logo design, religious art, announcements, graphic design and commissioned calligraphic art, cut 
        stone inscriptions, and memorial documents. It is also used for props and moving images for film and television, and also 
        for testimonials, birth and death certificates, maps, and other written works.</p> 
     <h4>2.History</h4>
     <p>
      In ancient China, the oldest known Chinese characters are oracle bone script (甲骨文), carved on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons,
       because the rulers in the Shang Dynasty carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, 
       agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather.[clarification needed] During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, 
       the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978). With the development of Jīnwén 
       (Bronzeware script) and Dàzhuàn (Large Seal Script) "cursive" signs continued. Mao Gong Ding is one of the most famous and typical 
       Bronzeware scripts in Chinese calligraphic history. It has 500 characters on the bronze which is the largest number of bronze inscription 
       we have discovered so far. Moreover, each archaic kingdom of current China had its own set of characters.

      In Imperial China, the graphs on old steles—some dating from 200 BCE, and in Xiaozhuan style—are still accessible[clarify].
      
      About 220 BCE, the emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them Li Si's 
      character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized Xiǎozhuàn (小篆) characters. Despite the fact that the main writing implement 
      of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.
      
      The Lìshū style (隸書/隸书) (clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, were also authorised under Qin Shi Huangdi.
      
      Between clerical script and traditional regular script, there is another transitional type of calligraphic work called Wei Bei. 
      It started during the North and South dynasties (420 to 589 CE) and ended before the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
      
      Kǎishū style (traditional regular script)—still in use today—and attributed to Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303-361) and his followers, is even more regularized.
      Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926-933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. 
      Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of 
      Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in 
      modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to the old style.
      
      Styles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix of 80% Xiaozhuan style, and 20% Lishu style. Some variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or 
      locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to 
      some newly created characters, compose the Simplified Chinese character set.

     <h4>3.Technique</h4>
      <p>
        Traditional East Asian writing uses the Four Treasures of the Study (文房四寶/文房四宝): ink brushes known as máobǐ (毛筆/毛笔) , Chinese ink,
        paper, and inkstones to write Chinese characters. These instruments of writing are also known as the Four Friends of the Study 
        (Korean: 문방사우/文房四友, romanized: Munbang sau) in Korea. Besides the traditional four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used.

Many different parameters influence the final result of a calligrapher's work. Physical parameters include the shape, size, stretch, and hair 
type of the ink brush; the color, color density and water density of the ink; as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture. 
The calligrapher's technique also influences the result, as the look of finished characters are influenced by the quantity of ink and water the 
calligraper lets the brush take and by the pressure, inclination, and direction of the brush. Changing these variables produces thinner or bolder 
strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations and decelerations of a skilled calligrapher's movements aim to give 
"spirit" to the characters, greatly influencing their final shapes.
      </p>
     <h4>4.Styles</h4>
       <p>In <a href="#">eastern countries</a> cursive styles such as xongshū (行書 / ) (semi-cursive or run) and cǎoshū (草書 / ) (cursive, rough, or grassy) are 
         less constrained and faster , where more movements are performed by the writing instrument. visible. The stroke order of these styles varies 
         more, sometimes creating completely different forms. They are derived from the Clerk script, contemporaneous with the Lowercase (Han Dynasty) 
         script, but xongshū and cǎoshū were used only for personal notes, and were never used as a standard. The cǎoshū style was highly valued during 
         the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (140-187 AD)

        Examples of modern printing styles are the Song printing house of the Song dynasty, and sans-serif. These are not considered traditional styles and are not usually writte.

       <p>
        Sacred <a href="#">Western calligraphy</a>  has some unique features, such as the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. 
        A decorative "carpet page" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The Lindisfarne Gospels (715-720 CE) are an early example.

As with Chinese or Islamic calligraphy, Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a 
"geometrical" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise stroke order.

Unlike a typeface, irregularity in the characters' size, style, and colors increases aesthetic value,[dubious - discuss] though the content may be illegible. 
Many of the themes and variations of today's contemporary <a href="#">Western calligraphy</a> are found in the pages of The Saint John's Bible. A particularly modern example is Timothy Botts' 
illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy typeface.
